## Historical Levers

  - Shifts in university presidents sometimes refocused priorities on academics vs. athletics, affecting coach stability.

  - Legislative attitudes toward funding can sway non-revenue sports support.

  - Baseball carries legacy prestige from icons like Cliff Gustafson and Augie Garrido.
